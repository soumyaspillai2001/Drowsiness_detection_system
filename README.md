# Drowsiness_detection_system
Drowsy driving is a significant contributor to road accidents, often leading to severe consequences.  This project aims to build a reliable system that can detect drowsiness in real time by analyzing  the driver’s eye state. 
This system will monitor a driver’s eyes to detect signs of drowsiness and provide timely alerts to prevent potential accidents caused by fatigue. 
Leveraging Python, OpenCV, Tensorflow and Keras, the system will classify eye states (open or closed) and trigger an alarm if drowsiness is detected. The System is built Convolutional Neural network model (CNN) for image classification and uses Computer vision techniques. 
This project aims to improve road safety by helping prevent accidents, especially during long-distance or night-time driving.
